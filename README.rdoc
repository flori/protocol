=== Description

This library offers an implementation of protocols against which you can
check the conformity of your classes or instances of your classes. They are a
bit like Java Interfaces, but as mixin modules they can also contain already
implemented methods. Additionally you can define preconditions/postconditions
for methods specified in a protocol.

=== Usage

This defines a protocol named +Enumerating+:

 Enumerating = Protocol do
   # Iterate over each element of this Enumerating class and pass it to the
   # +block+.
   def each(&block) end

   include Enumerable
 end

Every class, that conforms to this protocol, has to implement the understood
messages (+each+ in this example - with no ordinary arguments and a block
argument). The following would be an equivalent protocol definition:

 Enumerating = Protocol do
   # Iterate over each element of this Enumerating class and pass it to the
   # +block+.
   understand :each, 0, true

   include Enumerable
 end

An example of a conforming class is the class +Ary+:
 class Ary
   def initialize
     @ary = [1, 2, 3]
   end
 
   def each(&block)
     @ary.each(&block)
   end
 
   conform_to Enumerating
 end

The last line (this command being the last line of the class definition is
important!) of class +Ary+ <tt>conform_to Enumerating</tt> checks the
conformance of +Ary+ to the +Enumerating+ protocol. If the +each+ method were
not implemented in +Ary+ a CheckFailed exception would have been thrown,
containing all the offending CheckError instances.

It also mixes in all the methods that were included in protocol +Enumerating+
(+Enumerable+'s instance methods). More examples of this can be seen in the
examples sub directory of the source distribution of this library in file
examples/enumerating.rb.

==== Template Method Pattern

It's also possible to mix protocol specification and behaviour implementation
like this:

  Locking = Protocol do
    specification # not necessary, because Protocol defaults to specification
                  # mode already
  
    def lock() end
    
    def unlock() end
  
    implementation
  
    def synchronize
      lock
      begin
        yield
      ensure
        unlock
      end
    end
  end

This specifies a Locking protocol against which several class implementations
can be checked against for conformance. Here's a FileMutex implementation:

 class FileMutex
   def initialize
     @tempfile = Tempfile.new 'file-mutex'
   end

   def path
     @tempfile.path
   end

   def lock
     puts "Locking '#{path}'."
     @tempfile.flock File::LOCK_EX
   end

   def unlock
     puts "Unlocking '#{path}'."
     @tempfile.flock File::LOCK_UN
   end

   conform_to Locking
 end

The Locking#synchronize method is a template method (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern), that uses the
implemtented methods, to make block based locking possbile:

 mutex = FileMutex.new
 mutex.synchronize do
   puts "Synchronized with '#{file.path}'."
 end
 
Now it's easy to swap the implementation to a memory based mutex
implementation instead:

 class MemoryMutex
   def initialize
     @mutex = Mutex.new
   end

   def lock
     @mutex.lock
   end

   def unlock
     @mutex.unlock
   end

   conform_to Locking # actually Mutex itself would conform as well ;)
 end

To check an +object+ for conformity to the Locking protocol call
Locking.check +object+ and rescue a CheckFailed. Here's an example class

 class MyClass
   def initialize
     @mutex = FileMutex.new
   end

   attr_reader :mutex

   def mutex=(mutex)
     Locking.check mutex
     @mutex = mutex
   end
 end

This causes a CheckFailed exception to be thrown:
 obj.mutex = Object.new

This would not raise an exception:
 obj.mutex = MemoryMutex.new

And neither would this

 obj.mutex = Mutex.new # => #<Mutex:0xb799a4f0 @locked=false, @waiting=[]>

because coincidentally this is true

 Mutex.conform_to? Locking # => true

and thus Locking.check doesn't throw an exception. See the
examples/locking.rb file for code.

==== Preconditions and Postconditions

You can add additional runtime checks for method arguments and results by
specifying pre- and postconditions. Here is the classical stack example, that
shows how:

 StackProtocol = Protocol do
   def push(x)
     postcondition { top === x }
     postcondition { result === myself }
   end
 
   def top() end
 
   def size() end
 
   def empty?()
     postcondition { size === 0 ? result : !result }
   end
 
   def pop()
     s = size
     precondition { not empty? }
     postcondition { size === s - 1 }
   end
 end

Defining protocols and checking against conformance doesn't get in the way of
Ruby's duck typing, but you can still use protocols to define, document, and
check implementations that you expect from client code.

==== Error modes in Protocols

You can set different error modes for your protocols. By default the mode is
set to :error, and a failed protocol conformance check raises a CheckError (a
marker module) exception. Alternatively you can set the error mode to
:warning with:

 Foo = Protocol do
   check_failure :warning
 end

during Protocol definition or later

  Foo.check_failure :warning

In :warning mode no execptions are raised, only a warning is printed to
STDERR. If you set the error mode via Protocol::ProtocolModule#check_failure
to :none, nothing will happen on conformance check failures.
